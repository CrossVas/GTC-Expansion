# GTC Expansion
# About 
GTC Expansion is an addon to GT Classic adding various machines and such. This fork will be going alongside main repo, but will include a more GT4 centered content (mostly recipes, tools, mod integration). 

# Current State
I am currently creating the mod. I would say it's 40% - 50% finished. 
As for this fork, it's 80 - 90% done. Mostly mod integration to do and steam age (maybe, not sure yet). Releases will be placed on github once I add or fix something.

# Issues
Please report any issues you find to the issue tracker on this repository. Include as much information as possible including as version and steps to reproduce. Also pleaseuse the included formats.

# Contribution
Please do! Fork away and PR all you like. I just ask that you attempt you integrate your code properly into the existing codebase.

# Differences
- Added Saw Tool. Planks and sticks now need Saw for crafting (configurable);
- Made "craftingTool"s look like GT4 tools (handle color);
- Tweaked GTCX (and some of GTC recipe) to be more GT4-like;
- Added toolTips for "craftingTool";
- "craftingTool" now takes more than 1 damage for crafting;
- Added 2 "Stone" machines, Compressor and Extractor;
- Added Raw Rubber. Now you cannot obtain rubber directly from Sticky Resin, you will need Stone Extractor for that;
