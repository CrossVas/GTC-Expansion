# About 
GT Classic is a combination of content and features from all GregTech's (and some new) arranged into an addon for IC2 Classic 1.12.2.
The goal is create a crossroads where new and old GT players can have a meaningful and unencumbered experience. Join the discussion in Bear989's GT Help Discord https://discord.gg/W7CPXE8

# Current State
I am currently still creating the chemistry and progression. However stable downloads for pre-alpha testing are now available [here](https://bearsden.overminddl1.com/Downloads/GT%20Classics(E99999)/) 
which are updated weekly. *WARNING the mod is basically a sketchboard of evolving ideas, please do not complain about missing blocks or items as various updates could break previous worlds.*

# Issues
Please report any issues you find to the issue tracker on this repository. Include as much information as possible including as version and steps to reproduce.

# Contribution
Please do! Fork away and PR all you like, my goal after alpha is have contributors filling out content as well as myself. Please do not feel limited to content from previous Gregtechs in your ideas. I just ask that you attempt you integrate your code properly into the existing codebase.
